## Company Overview
AtliQ Hardware is one of the leading computer hardware and accessory manufacturers, operating across four major regions: 
- NA
- LATAM
- EU
- APAC.
  
The company specializes in three primary divisions:
- Networking & Storage
- PC
- Peripherals & Accessories

Despite its global presence, the management identified a lack of actionable insights to make quick and data-driven decisions. To address this, they sought to enhance their analytics capabilities by conducting a SQL challenge to identify skilled junior data analysts.
